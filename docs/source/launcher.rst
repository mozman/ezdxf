   :align: center

                            select the layout to draw, default is "Model"
      --lwscale LWSCALE     set custom line weight scaling, default is 0 to
                            disable line weights at all

.. _browse_command:

Browse
------

Browse the internal structure of a DXF file like a file system:

.. code-block:: Text

    C:\> ezdxf browse gear.dxf


.. figure:: gfx/gear-browse.png

.. code-block:: Text

    C:\> ezdxf browse -h
    usage: ezdxf browse [-h] [-l LINE] [-g HANDLE] [FILE]

    positional arguments:
      FILE                  DXF file to browse

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -l LINE, --line LINE  go to line number
      -g HANDLE, --handle HANDLE
                            go to entity by HANDLE, HANDLE has to be a hex value without
                            any prefix like 'fefe'

The `browse` command stores options in the config file,
e.g. for the `Notepad++` on Windows:

.. code-block:: ini

    [browse-command]

    text_editor = "C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "{filename}" -n{num}
    icon_size = 32

``text_editor`` is a simple format string:
:code:`text_editor.format(filename="test.dxf", num=100)`

Quote commands including spaces and always quote the filename argument!

For `xed` on Linux Mint use (note: absolute path to executable):

.. code-block:: ini

    [browse-command]

    text_editor = /usr/bin/xed "{filename}" +{num}
    icon_size = 32

For `gedit` on Linux use (untested):

.. code-block:: ini

    [browse-command]

    text_editor = /usr/bin/gedit +{num} "{filename}"
    icon_size = 32

The *browse* command opens a DXF structure browser to investigate the
internals of a DXF file without interpreting the content. The intended usage is 
debugging invalid DXF files, which can not be loaded by the :func:`ezdxf.readfile()` or
the :func:`ezdxf.recover.readfile()` functions.

Line Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The low level tag loader ignores DXF comments (group code 999). If there are
comments in the DXF file the line numbers displayed in the DXF browser are
not synchronized, use the `strip`_ command beforehand to remove all comments
from the DXF file in order to keep the line numbers synchronized.

GUI Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tree view on the left shows the outline of the DXF file. The number in round
brackets on the right side of each item shows the count of structure entities
within the structure layer, the value in angle brackets on the left side is
the entity handle.

The right list view shows the entity content as DXF tags.
Structure tags (data type <ctrl>) are shown in blue, a double click on a reference
handle (datatype <ref>) jumps to the referenced entity, reference handles of
non-existent targets are shown in red.

Clicking on the first structure tag in the list opens the DXF reference provided
by Autodesk in the standard web browser.

Auto Reload
~~~~~~~~~~~

The browser automatically displays a dialog for reloading DXF files if they have
been modified by an external application.

.. _browse_acis__command:

Browse-ACIS
-----------

Show and export the :term:`SAT` or :term:`SAB` content of :term:`ACIS` entities:

.. code-block:: Text

    C:\> ezdxf browse-acis 3dsolid.dxf

.. image:: gfx/browse-acis-3dsolid.png
   :align: center

The DXF format stores modern solid geometry as :term:`SAT` data for DXF R2000 -
R2010 and as :term:`SAB` data for DXF R2013 and later. This command shows the
content of this entities and also let you export the raw data for further
processing.

Entity View
~~~~~~~~~~~

The entity view is a read-only text editor, it's possible to select and copy
parts of the text into the clipboard.
To improve the readability all ACIS entities get automatically an id because
AutoCAD and BricsCAD use relative references for ACIS data export and do not
assign entity ids.
The id is shown as decimal number in parenthesis after the entity
name. The ``~`` character is a shortcut for a null-pointer.

.. code-block:: Text

    C:\>ezdxf browse-acis -h
    usage: ezdxf browse-acis [-h] [-g HANDLE] [FILE]

    positional arguments:
      FILE                  DXF file to browse

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -g HANDLE, --handle HANDLE
                            go to entity by HANDLE, HANDLE has to be a hex value
                            without any prefix like 'fefe'

.. _Info_command:

Info
----

Show information and optional stats of DXF files as loaded by `ezdxf`, this may
not represent the original content of the file, use the `browse`_ command to see
the original content. The upgrade is necessary for very old DXF versions
prior to R12 and for the "special" versions R13 and R14. The `-s` option shows
some statistics about the DXF content like entity count or table count. Use the
`-v` option show more of everything.

This is the verbose output for an old DXF R10 file and shows that the loading
process created some required structures which do not exist in DXF R10 files,

.. _hpgl_command:

HPGL/2 Viewer/Converter
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.1

The ``hpgl`` command shows and/or converts `HPGL/2`_ plot files to DXF, SVG or PDF.

DXF
~~~

The page content is created at the origin of the modelspace and 1 drawing unit is 1
plot unit (1 plu = 0.025mm) unless scaling values are provided.

The content of HPGL files is intended to be plotted on white paper, so the appearance on
a dark background in modelspace is not very clear. To fix this, the ``--map_black_to_white``
option maps black fillings and lines to white.

All entities are mapped to a layer named  ``COLOR_<#>`` according to the pen number.
In order to process the content better, it is also possible to assign the DXF elements an
ACI color value according to the pen number through the ``--aci`` option, but then the
RGB color is lost because the RGB color always has the higher priority over the
:term:`ACI` value.

The first paperspace layout "Layout0" is set up to print the entire modelspace on one
sheet, the size of the page is the size of the original plot file in millimeters.

SVG
~~~

The plot units are mapped 1:1 to ``viewBox`` units and the size of image is the size of
the original plot file in millimeters.

PDF
~~~

The plot units are converted to PDF units (1/72 inch) so the size of image is the
size of the original plot file in millimeters.

All Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~

HPGL/2's merge control works at the pixel level and cannot be replicated by DXF,
but to prevent fillings from obscuring text, the filled polygons are
sorted by luminance - this can be forced or disabled by the ``--merge_control`` option.

Some plot files that contain pure HPGL/2 code do not contain the escape sequence
"Enter HPGL/2 mode", without this sequence the HPGL/2 parser cannot recognize the
beginning of the HPGL/2 code. The ``--force`` option inserts the "Enter HPGL/2 mode"
escape sequence into the data stream, regardless of whether the file is an HPGL/2 plot
file or not, so be careful.

                            command line (no gui)
      -r {0,90,180,270}, --rotate {0,90,180,270}
                            rotate page about 90, 180 or 270 degrees (no gui)
      -x SX, --scale_x SX   scale page in x-axis direction, use negative values to
                            mirror page, (no gui)
      -y SY, --scale_y SY   scale page in y-axis direction, use negative values to
                            mirror page (no gui)
      -m {0,1,2}, --merge_control {0,1,2}
                            provides control over the order of filled polygons, 0=off
                            (print order), 1=luminance (order by luminance), 2=auto
                            (default)
      -f, --force           inserts the mandatory 'enter HPGL/2 mode' escape sequence
                            into the data stream; use this flag when no HPGL/2 data was
                            found and you are sure the file is a HPGL/2 plot file
      --aci                 use pen numbers as ACI colors (DXF only)
      --map_black_to_white  map black RGB plot colors to white RGB, does not affect ACI
