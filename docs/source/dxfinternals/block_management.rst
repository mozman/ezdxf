Block Management Structures
===========================

A BLOCK is a kind of layout like the model space or a paper space, with the similarity that all these layouts
are containers for other graphical DXF entities. This block definition can be referenced in other layouts by the
INSERT entity. By using block references the same set of graphical entities can be located multiple times at
different layouts, this block references can be stretched and rotated without modifying the original entities. A
block is referenced only by its name defined by the DXF tag :code:`(2, name)`, there is a second DXF tag
:code:`(3, name2)` for the block name, which is not further documented by Autodesk, and I haven't tested what happens I
the second name is different to the first block name.

The :code:`(10, base_point)` tag (in BLOCK defines a insertion point of the block, by 'inserting' a block by
the INSERT entity, this point of the block is placed at the location defined by the :code:`(10, insert)` tag in
the INSERT entity, and it is also the base point for stretching and rotation.

A block definition can contain INSERT entities, and it is possible to create cyclic block definitions (a
BLOCK contains a INSERT of itself), but this should be avoided, CAD applications will not load the DXF file at all or
maybe just crash. This is also the case for all other kinds of cyclic definitions like: BLOCK 'A' -> INSERT BLOCK 'B'
and BLOCK 'B' -> INSERT BLOCK 'A'.

Block Names
-----------

Block names has to be unique and they are case insensitive ('Test' == 'TEST'). If there are two or more block
definitions with the same name, AutoCAD (LT 2018) merges these blocks into a single block with unpredictable properties
of all these blocks. In my test with two blocks, the final block has the name of the first block and the base-point of
the second block, and contains all entities of both blocks.

Block Definitions in DXF R12
----------------------------

In DXF R12 the definition of a block is located in the BLOCKS section, no additional structures are needed.
The definition starts with a BLOCK entity and ends with a ENDBLK entity. All entities between this
two entities are the content of the block, the block is the owner of this entities like any layout.

As shown in the DXF file below (created by AutoCAD LT 2018), the BLOCK entity has no handle, but ezdxf writes
also handles for the BLOCK entity and AutoCAD doesn't complain.

DXF R12 BLOCKS structure:

.. code-block:: none

    SECTION
    2           <<< start of BLOCKS section

    ...
    0           <<< end BLOCK entity
    ENDBLK
    0           <<< end of BLOCKS section
    ENDSEC

Block Definitions in DXF R2000 and later
----------------------------------------

The overall organization in the BLOCKS sections remains the same, but additional tags in the BLOCK entity, have to be
maintained.

Especially the concept of ownership is important. Since DXF R13 every graphic entity is associated to a specific layout,
and a BLOCK definition is a kind of layout. So all entities in the BLOCK definition, including the BLOCK and the ENDBLK
entities, have an owner tag :code:`(330, ...)`, which points to a BLOCK_RECORD entry in the BLOCK_RECORD table.
As you can see in the chapter about :ref:`Layout Management Structures`, this concept is also valid for model space
and paper space layouts, because these layouts are also BLOCKS, with the special difference, that entities of the model
space and the `active` paper space are stored in the ENTITIES section.
