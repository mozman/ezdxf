DXF File Encoding
=================

The following facts are not in the DXF Standard. But this facts are established by the AutoCAD application.

DXF Version R2004 and prior
---------------------------

Drawing files of DXF versions R2004 (AC1018) and prior are saved as ASCII files with the encoding set by the header
variable *$DWGCODEPAGE*, which is ANSI_1252 by default if *$DWGCODEPAGE* is not set.

Characters used in the drawing which do not exist in the chosen ASCII encoding are encoded as unicode characters with
the schema ``\U+nnnn``. see `Unicode table`_

DXF Version R2007 and later
---------------------------

Starting with DXF version R2007 (AC1021) the drawing files are saved with UTF-8 encoding, the header variable
*$DWGCODEPAGE* is still in use, but I don't know if the setting has any meaning.

Encoding characters in the unicode schema ``\U+nnnn`` is still functional.
