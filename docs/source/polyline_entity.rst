Polyline
========

.. class:: Polyline(GraphicEntity)

The POLYLINE entity is very complex, it's used to build 2D/3D polylines, 3D meshes and 3D polyfaces. For every type
exists a different wrapper class but they all have the same dxftype of POLYLINE. Detect the polyline type by
:meth:`Polyline.get_mode`.

Create 2D polylines in layouts and blocks by factory function :meth:`~Layout.add_polyline2D`.

For 2D entities all points in :ref:`OCS`.

Create 3D polylines in layouts and blocks by factory function :meth:`~Layout.add_polyline3D`.

For 3D entities all points in :ref:`WCS`.
