Trace
=====

.. class:: Trace(GraphicEntity)

A Trace is solid filled triangle or quadrilateral, dxftype is TRACE. Access corner points by name
(:code:`entity.dxf.vtx0 = (1.7, 2.3)`) or by index (:code:`entity[0] = (1.7, 2.3)`). I don't know the difference
between SOLID and TRACE.
Create traces in layouts and blocks by factory function :meth:`~Layout.add_trace`.
