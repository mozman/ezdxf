Application Settings
====================

.. module:: ezdxf.appsettings

This is a high-level module for working with CAD application settings and behaviors.
None of these settings have any influence on the behavior of `ezdxf`, since
`ezdxf` only takes care of the content of the DXF file and not of the way it is
presented to the user.

.. important::

    You need to understand that these settings work at the application level,
    `ezdxf` cannot force an application to do something in a certain way!
    The functionality of this module has been tested with Autodesk TrueView and
    BricsCAD, other applications may show different results or ignore the
    settings.

Set Current Properties
----------------------

The current properties are used by the CAD application to create new entities,
these settings do not affect how `ezdxf` creates new entities.

The module :mod:`ezdxf.gfxattribs` provides the class :meth:`~ezdxf.gfxattribs.GfxAttribs`,
which can load the current graphical entity settings from the HEADER section
for creating new entities by `ezdxf`: :meth:`~ezdxf.gfxattribs.GfxAttribs.load_from_header`
