        1    Anonymous block generated by hatching, associative dimensioning, other internal operations, or an application
        2    Block has non-constant attribute definitions (this bit is not set if the block has any attribute
             definitions that are constant, or has no attribute definitions at all)
        4    Block is an external reference (xref)
        8    Block is an xref overlay
        16   Block is externally dependent
        32   This is a resolved external reference, or dependent of an external reference (ignored on input)
