Bezier curves
=============

https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2000/AGraphHCI/SMEG/node3.html

A Bezier curve is a weighted sum of n+1 control points,  P0, P1, ..., Pn, where 
the weights are the Bernstein polynomials. 

The Bezier curve of order n+1 (degree n) has n+1 control points. These are the 
first three orders of Bezier curve definitions. 

(75) linear P(t) = (1-t)*P0 + t*P1
(76) quadratic P(t) = (1-t)^2*P0 + 2*(t-1)*t*P1 + t^2*P2
(77) cubic P(t) = (1-t)^3*P0 + 3*(1-t)^2*t*P1 + 3*(1-t)*t^2*P2 + t^3*P3

Ways of thinking about Bezier curves
------------------------------------

There are several useful ways in which you can think about Bezier curves. 
Here are the ones that I use.

Linear interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equation (75) is obviously a linear interpolation between two points. Equation 
(76) can be rewritten as a linear interpolation between linear interpolations 
between points.

Weighted average
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Bezier curve can be seen as a weighted average of all of its control points. 
Because all of the weights are positive, and because the weights sum to one, the 
Bezier curve is guaranteed to lie within the convex hull of its control points.
    
Refinement of the control polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Bezier curve can be seen as some sort of refinement of the polygon made by 
connecting its control points in order. The Bezier curve starts and ends at the 
two end points and its shape is determined by the relative positions of the n-1 
other control points, although it will generally not pass through these other 
control points. The tangent vectors at the start and end of the curve pass 
through the end point and the immediately adjacent point.

Continuity
----------

You should note that each Bezier curve is independent of any other Bezier curve. 
If we wish two Bezier curves to join with any type of continuity, then we must 
explicitly position the control points of the second curve so that they bear 
the appropriate relationship with the control points in the first curve.

Any Bezier curve is infinitely differentiable within itself, and is therefore 
continuous to any degree.

class Bezier:
    """A `Bézier curve`_ is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and
    related fields. Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be
    scaled indefinitely. "Paths", as they are commonly referred to in image
    manipulation programs, are combinations of linked Bézier curves.
    Paths are not bound by the limits of rasterized images and are intuitive to
    modify. (Source: Wikipedia)
