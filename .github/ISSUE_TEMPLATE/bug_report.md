**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Information and data needed to reproduce the error:
1. A *simplified* Python script which triggers the error.
2. Information about the *ezdxf* version and the OS.
3. If a 3rd party DXF file causes the error, add a *simplified* and *zipped* 
   DXF file which still triggers the error.

**Confidential Data**
If you have sensitive files that you can't disclose, try to remove everything 
sensitive from an existing file or create a brand new one which still triggers 
the error. Alternatively, you can send the zipped files to confidential@mozman.at, 
this data is only saved locally (no cloud upload of any kind) and the files are 
deleted after the error has been fixed.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
