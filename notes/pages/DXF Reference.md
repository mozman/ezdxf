# Quality of the DXF Reference
	- The DXF reference is by far no specification nor a standard like the W3C standard for [[SVG]] or the ISO standard for [[PDF]].
	- The reference describes many but not all [[DXF]] entities and some basic concepts like the tag structure or the arbitrary axis algorithm.
	- But the existing documentation (reference) is incomplete and partly misleading or wrong.
	- Also missing from the reference are some important parts like the complex relationship between the entities to create higher order structures like block definitions, layouts (model space & paper space) or dynamic blocks to name a few.
