# Release Notes for v1.4.0
	- Changelog: ((676bc8de-2863-4635-945c-4ef79a74d93e))
- ## New Modules to Find Chains and Loops
	- The `ezdxf.edgeminer` module for seaching of connected edges and closed loops to:
		- build polylines from DXF primitives like LINE, ARC, ELLIPSE, SPLINE
		- build hatch boundary paths from DXF primitives
		- find open chains or closed loops in an unordered heap of DXF primitives (edges)
		- in general: find connections between edges
	- The `ezdxf.edgesmith` module for creating edges from DXF entities and creating polylines and hatches from connected edges:
		- create edges from DXF primitives for processing by the `edgeminer` module:
			- LINE, ARC, ELLIPSE, SPLINE, LWPOLYLINE, POLYLINE
		- create LWPOLYLINE and POLYLINE entities from a sequence of edges.
		- create HATCH boundary paths from a sequence of edges.
		- create `ezdxf.path.Path` objects from a sequence of edges.
