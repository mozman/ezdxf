## Proxy Graphic
	- The [[ProxyGraphic]] **is not stored** in subclass [[AcDbEntity]] as in every other entity
	- The [[ProxyGraphic]] is stored in subclass [[AcDbProxyEntity]]
	- There are multiple binary chunks with group code 310 and a preceding length tag
	- Each chunk has a different group code for the length tag
	- My assumption was:
		- The [[ProxyGraphic]] chunk has a group code of 92 or 160 for the length tag - dependent on the DXF version
		- 92 for DXF2010 and earlier
		- 160 for DXF R2013 and later
	- This assumption was **wrong**
		- {{issue 978}}
		- DXF R2010 file with group code 160 as length tag for the [[ProxyGraphic]] binary chunk
	- The solution is to try both group codes for the length tag and the first existing binary chunk will be taken as [[ProxyGraphic]]
