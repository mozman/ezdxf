- **TLDR;** Would you expect Photoshop features from a JPG library?
- The package is designed as an interface to the [[DXF]] format and therefore does not offer any advanced features of interactive CAD applications.
- First, some tasks are difficult to perform without human guidance, and second, in complex situations, it's not that easy to tell a "headless" system what exactly to do, so it's very likely that not many users would ever use these features, despite the fact that a lot of time and effort would have to be spent on development, testing and long-term support.
