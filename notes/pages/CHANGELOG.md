	- NEW: `pycsg` add-on, a simple Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) kernel created by Evan Wallace (Javascript) and 
	  Tim Knip (Python)
	- CHANGE: Changed predefined pattern scaling to BricsCAD and AutoCAD standard, set global option 
	  `ezdxf.options.use_old_predefined_pattern_scaling` to True, to use the old pattern scaling before v0.11
	- CHANGE: removed `ezdxf.PATTERN` constant, use `PATTERN = ezdxf.pattern.load()` instead, set argument 
	  `old_pattern=True` to use the old pattern scaling before v0.11

	-
- ## Version 0.10.1 - 2019-09-07
	- BUGFIX: group code for header var $ACADMAINTVER is 90 for DXF R2018+ and 70 for previous DXF versions. This is a 
	  critical bug because AutoCAD 2012/2013 (and possibly earlier versions) will not open DXF files with the new group 
	  code 90 for header variable $ACADMAINTVER.
	-
- ## Version 0.10 - 2019-09-01
	- Release notes: https://ezdxf.mozman.at/release-v0-10.html
	- unified entity system for all DXF versions

		- new `log_unprocessed_tags` to log unprocessed (unknown) DXF tags
	- CHANGE: `Dimension()` removes associated anonymous dimension block at deletion

	- CHANGE: `Importer` add-on rewritten, API incompatible to previous ezdxf versions, but previous implementation was 
	    already broken
	- CHANGE: moved `add_attdef()` to generic layout interface, adding ATTDEF to model- and paperspace is possible
	- CHANGE: entity query - exclude DXF types from `'*'` search, by appending type name with a preceding '!' e.g. query for 
	  all entities except LINE = `"* !LINE"`
	- CHANGE: entity query - removed regular expression support for type name match
	- CHANGE: integration of `MTextData` methods into `MText`

	- BUGFIX: VERTEX entity inherit `owner` and `linetype` attribute from POLYLINE entity
	- BUGFIX: MTEXT - replacement of `\n` by `\P` at DXF export to avoid invalid DXF files.
	- tested with CPython 3.8
	- removed batch files (.bat) for testing, use `tox` command instead
	-

	- CHANGE: converted NEWS.rst to NEWS.md and README.rst to README.md
	- CHANGE: moved `Importer()` from `ezdxf.tools` to `ezdxf.addons` - internal structures of modern DXF files are too complex
	  and too undocumented to support importing data in a reliable way - using `Importer()` may corrupt your DXF files or just 
	  don't work!
	- NEW: type annotations to core package and add-ons.
	- NEW: argument `setup` in `ezdxf.new('R12', setup=True)` to setup default line types, text styles and dimension styles, 
	  this feature is disabled by default.
	- NEW: Duplicate table entries: `dwg.styles.duplicate_entry('OpenSans', new_name='OpenSansNew')`, this works for 
	  all tables, but is intended to duplicate STYLES and DIMSTYLES.

	  `rstrip_points()`; user defined point format;
	- NEW: packed data for SPLINE, knots, weights, fit- and control points are stored as `array.array()`;
	  `Spline.get_knot_values()`, `Spline.get_weights()`, `Spline.get_control_points()` and `Spline.get_fit_points()` are 
	  deprecated, direct access to this attributes by `Spline.knot_values`, `Spline.weights`, `Spline.control_points` and 
	  `Spline.fit_points`, all attributes with a list-like interface. Knot, control point and fit point counter updated 
	  automatically, therefore counters are read only now.
	- NEW: packed data for MESH, vertices, faces, edges and edge crease values stored as `array.array()`, high level interface unchanged
	- NEW: `Drawing.layouts_and_blocks()`, iterate over all layouts (mode space and paper space) and all block definitions.

	- NEW: Basic support for embedded objects (new in AutoCAD 2018), ezdxf reads and writes the embedded data as it is,
	  no interpretation no modification, just enough to not break DXF files with embedded objects at saving.
	- CHANGE: `Drawing.blocks.delete_block(name, safe=True)`, new parameter save, check if block is still referenced
	  (raises `DXFValueError`)
	- CHANGE: `Drawing.blocks.delete_all_blocks(safe=True)`, if parameter safe is `True`, do not delete blocks that are still referenced
	- BUGFIX: invalid CLASS definition for DXF version R2000 (AC1015) fixed, bug was only triggered at upgrading from R13/R14 to R2000

	- NEW: warns about multiple block definitions with the same name in a DXF file. (DXFStructureError)
	- NEW: legacy_mode parameter in ezdxf.read() and ezdxf.readfile(): tries do fix coordinate order in LINE entities (10, 11, 20, 21) by the cost of around 5% overall speed penalty at DXF file loading
