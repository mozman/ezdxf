- Issue [#962](https://github.com/mozman/ezdxf/issues/962) [[PDF]] with transparent background
	- I am not sure if the [[PyMuPDF]] supports transparent backgrounds.
	- I couldn't find any solution [[Stackoverflow]].
	- I didn't find any hint how to set the background color or tansparency in the source code of the package
	- ChatGPT:
		- As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, PyMuPDF (MuPDF bindings 
		  for Python) doesn't provide a direct way to set a transparent background
		   for a page. The library is primarily focused on reading and rendering 
		  PDF documents, and its API may not include features for advanced PDF 
		  creation or modification.
