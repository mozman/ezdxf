# ezdxf

## Abstract

This Python package is designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of DXF 
documents, with compatibility across various DXF versions. It empowers users to 
seamlessly load and edit DXF files while preserving all content, except for comments.

Any unfamiliar DXF tags encountered in the document are gracefully ignored but retained 
for future modifications. This feature enables the processing of DXF documents 
containing data from third-party applications without any loss of valuable information.

## Quick-Info

- `ezdxf` is a Python package to create new DXF files and read/modify/write 
  existing DXF documents
- MIT-License
- the intended audience are programmers
- requires at least Python 3.9
- OS independent
- tested with CPython and pypy3
- has type annotations and passes `mypy --ignore-missing-imports -p ezdxf` successful
- additional required packages for the core package without add-ons
  - [typing_extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/)
  - [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/)
  - [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
  - [fontTools](https://pypi.org/project/fonttools/)
- read/write/new support for DXF versions: R12, R2000, R2004, R2007, R2010, R2013 and R2018
- additional read-only support for DXF versions R13/R14 (upgraded to R2000)
- additional read-only support for older DXF versions than R12 (upgraded to R12)
- read/write support for ASCII DXF and Binary DXF
- retains third-party DXF content
- optional C-extensions for CPython are included in the binary wheels, available 
  on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ezdxf/) for Windows, Linux and macOS
- command line script `ezdxf` to display, convert and inspect DXF files

## Included Extensions

Additional packages required for these add-ons are not automatically installed 
during the *basic* setup, for more information about the setup & dependencies 
visit the [documentation](https://ezdxf.mozman.at/docs/setup.html).

- The `drawing` add-on is a translation layer to send DXF data to a render backend, 
  interfaces to [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/), which can export 
  images as PNG, PDF or SVG, and [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) are implemented.
- `r12writer` add-on to write basic DXF entities direct and fast into a DXF R12 
  file or stream
- `iterdxf` add-on to iterate over DXF entities from the modelspace of huge DXF 
  files (> 5GB) which do not fit into memory
- `Importer` add-on to import entities, blocks and table entries from another DXF document
- `dxf2code` add-on to generate Python code for DXF structures loaded from DXF 
  documents as starting point for parametric DXF entity creation
- `acadctb` add-on to read/write plot style files (CTB/STB)
- `pycsg` add-on for basic Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling
- `MTextExplode` add-on for exploding MTEXT entities into single-line TEXT entities
- `text2path` add-on to convert text into outline paths
- `geo` add-on to support the [`__geo_interface__`](https://gist.github.com/sgillies/2217756)
- `meshex` for exchanging meshes with other tools as STL, OFF or OBJ files
- `openscad` add-on, an interface to [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org)
- `odafc` add-on, an interface to the [ODA File Converter](https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter) 
  to read and write DWG files
- `hpgl2` add-on for converting HPGL/2 plot files to DXF, SVG and PDF

A simple example:

```Python
import ezdxf
from ezdxf import colors
from ezdxf.enums import TextEntityAlignment

# Create a new DXF document.
doc = ezdxf.new(dxfversion="R2010")

# Create new table entries (layers, linetypes, text styles, ...).
doc.layers.add("TEXTLAYER", color=colors.RED)

# DXF entities (LINE, TEXT, ...) reside in a layout (modelspace, 
# paperspace layout or block definition).  
msp = doc.modelspace()

# Add entities to a layout by factory methods: layout.add_...() 
msp.add_line((0, 0), (10, 0), dxfattribs={"color": colors.YELLOW})
msp.add_text(
    "Test", 
    dxfattribs={
        "layer": "TEXTLAYER"
    }).set_placement((0, 0.2), align=TextEntityAlignment.CENTER)

# Save the DXF document.
doc.saveas("test.dxf")
```

Example for the *r12writer*, which writes a simple DXF R12 file without 
in-memory structures:

```Python
from random import random
from ezdxf.addons import r12writer

MAX_X_COORD = 1000
MAX_Y_COORD = 1000

with r12writer("many_circles.dxf") as doc:
    for _ in range(100000):
        doc.add_circle((MAX_X_COORD*random(), MAX_Y_COORD*random()), radius=2)
```

The r12writer supports only the ENTITIES section of a DXF R12 drawing, no HEADER, 
TABLES or BLOCKS section is present, except FIXED-TABLES are written, than some 
additional predefined text styles and line types are available.

## Installation

Basic installation by pip including the optional C-extensions from PyPI as 
binary wheels:

    pip install ezdxf

Full installation with all dependencies (matplotlib, PySide6) for using the 
drawing add-on:

    pip install ezdxf[draw]

For more information about the setup & dependencies visit the 
[documentation](https://ezdxf.mozman.at/docs/setup.html).

## Command Line

Use `python -m ezdxf ...` if your shell can't find the `ezdxf` script.

Get additional help for a sub-command:

    ezdxf <cmd> -h

Preview DXF files in a graphical window:

    ezdxf view <file.dxf>

Export the modelspace of DXF files as PNG|SVG|PDF:

    ezdxf draw -o file.<png|svg|pdf> <file.dxf>

Print basic information about DXF files:

    ezdxf info <file.dxf>

Show detailed information and structures of DXF files:

    ezdxf browse <file.dxf>

Audit DXF files:

    ezdxf audit <file.dxf>

Preview and convert HPGL/2 plot files:

    ezdxf hpgl <file.plt>
